# 1/before we use the file system to get user test case
# we might need to use 'incbin' to include the user case
# 2/if we use file system, we also need to use musl cc to complie it
# and put it into a image, so we actually need a user test case 

# this user dir should be put under modules
# for it can be ignored instead of a git submodule

# and it might be complied directly with another way

# the user repo is also can be configured
